<h2><b>About me</b></h2>
</div>
</div>
I'm a software engineer who has worked in various startups with projects ranging from robotics to satellite communications.  I worked at [Verance] where I was a primary engineer in creating and deploying Confirmedia, a nationwide radio ad tracking system that utilized audio watermarking.  In Hawaii, I joined [Nanopoint Imaging][nano] and helped develop the UI and hardware control layer of the cellTray Microfluidics and Imaging Systems.

Some of my latest personal project achievements include the webapp, [Contact Attack][ca] which took 3rd place in the [Viadeo Developer Challenge][via]. Along with Marion Ano and Bob Matcuk, I codeveloped the Loko Iʻa app, an IOS app that focuses on teaching the public about the history and restoration of He‘eia Fishpond. Myself along with [Mark Guillermo][mg], were also a top six finalist in the Campbell's API contest, [Hack the Kitchen][htk], with the product Recipe Remixed.

I'm also interested in entrepreneurship and Hawaii technology growth.  I've participated in several startup weekends and currently serve on the [Startup Weekend][sw] committee assisting in marketing and developer outreach.  I'm also an active board member in [HI Capacity] to help foster and build the local maker community.

My other interests include surfing, photography and creative technology.

<h2><b>About site</b></h2>

Back in the day, this site used to be [Wordpress] running on [Dreamhost] servers.  Now it's developed with [Jekyll] and running on [Github] servers.  Our images are currently by served by [Flickr].

By moving away from Wordpress, this site runs noticably faster and is completely free.  I would highly recommend this solution for any developer interested in putting up a blog.
