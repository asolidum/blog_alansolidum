<p>Bad Boys!!! Bad Boys!!! Whatcha gonna do?!? Whatcha gonna do when dey come for you?!?</p>

<p>Today I heard some loud engine noises reverberating throughout the house. It actually reminded me of when I used to live by USC. I ran outside and saw a helicopter about 20 feet above our backyard. :surprised:</p>

<p>Turns out a fugitive ran through the stream that runs between our house and the elementary school. Hmmm&#8230;Â  I hope Palolo isn&#8217;t going back to its <a href="http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/May/16/ln/ln03a.html">old ways</a>.</p>

<p>I snapped a few shots of the chopper and then got a picture of the first policeman to arrive on foot. He gave me a not so friendly look so I decided to put the trusty Rebel XT camera away. Post-&#8220;Rodney King&#8221; era, most cops don&#8217;t appreciate their pictures taken while on duty.</p>

<p>About 15 other officers arrived and asked if we noticed anything unusual. Uhhh no&#8230; Unless you mean the helicopter flying over our house and foot soldiers surrounding the area but other than that&#8230; All systems normal. :thumbs-up:</p>
