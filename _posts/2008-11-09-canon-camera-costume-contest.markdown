Many of you know that last year I decided to go to dress as a Canon Camera for Halloween.  If that is news to you, then click <a href="http://being.alansolidum.com/blogs/2007/10/31/costume-starts-with-c/">here</a> if you would like to read more about that.

Well one of my favorite sites is [Instructables][i], a website specializing in user-created and uploaded do-it-yourself projects.  I like to check it out every so often for ideas or when I want to customize something.

So they are having a DIY Halloween Contest and I decided to enter the Canon Camera Costume.  Two hours after entering the contest, I guess one of the editors deemed it novel or interesting enough to make it "featured".  So the geek in me can't help but not be a little proud.  :)

Check it out if you have a chance by clicking [here][iccc].  And while you are there why don't you cast a vote for you favorite costume as the voting ends Nov. 16th? Yeah, I know... Shameless plug...

Also check back here soon as I will be posting Halloween 2008 pictures soon...
